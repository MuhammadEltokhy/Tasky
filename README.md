# Tasky
This is Tasky. A small, basic task manager program runs on your terminal!
Tasky shows ur tasks in a scrollable table with columns Status & Titles. You're able to display the full task title and its status, when a row is highlighted.
Now, how to use it? It's simply easy. You only runs the Tasky.exe file in this reposity, and press "a" in your keyboard for adding new task, "c" for completing / uncompleting your selected task, "d" for deleting it, "/" to search for your task, "t" to toggle between light and dark theme as you wish, "Enter" button to show your task details in simple model, "up and down" buttons to navigate between tasks, and "q" if you want to close and quit the whole program. But wait, what about storing your tasks in the program!!! Nahh, Tasky solves it! When you add, or delete or any type of editing on your tasks, a file cald tasks.JSON will be created permenantly that saves everything that is happend on your app.
Now, start your self-enhancing year-plan with Tasky!
